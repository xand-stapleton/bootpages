### What is the conformal bootstrap and why are we interested in it?

We are interested in how machine learning techniques can be used in the conformal bootstrap programme. The conformal bootstrap is a framework in theoretical physics which is used to understand the properties of conformal field theories (CFTs) by exploring their inherent symmetries. By solving constraints using numerical methods, we uncover information about many properties of the CFTs uch as the spectrum; operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients, and scaling dimensions.

The conformal bootstrap has diverse applications in theoretical physics, such as describing the critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, and even applications in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Please see the below blog for a more complete list of the group's publications.
